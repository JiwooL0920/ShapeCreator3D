# Examples README

To try these examples just run `elm reactor` in the parent directory. Make sure you're using Elm 0.19.1.

**Note**:

`elm-3d-scene` now requires the scene dimensions to be in `Quantity Int Pixels`, not `Quantity Float Pixels` so examples might have to be updated accordingly.
Additionally, you should probably swap out anything using the *module* `Scene3d.Entity` to just use `Scene3d` instead.
